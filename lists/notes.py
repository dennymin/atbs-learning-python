# list contains multiple values in an ordered sequence
# you can pull a slice of information with a colon
# you can use multiple assignment in python
# using the enumerate() function will return the index of the item in the list and the item in the list itself
# using the random.choice() and random.shuffle() functions is also helpful with lists
# using the former will randomly select an item from the list while the latter will reoder the items into a new list. It will modify the list in place rather than returning a new list.
# strings in python are immutable while list values are mutable; they are still similar in that they are of sequential data types
# tuple data types are similar to list data types except that tuples are typed with parentheses and tuples are immutable
